talk about technical restrictions (eg only json objects in db storage, only strings as input params etc)

also talk about libraries like bigint, how to install/ use them...

talk about that you can split your contract in multiple ts files

i'd also like to fix the vite debugging capabilities of the contract and explain how to debug with breakpoints here

Also for first contract tutorial, i assume that we fixed the JSON only contraint of the persistance layer

Also talk about nodemon live rebuild
