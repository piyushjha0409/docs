title: Cross Chain DeFi & Wrapping
---

VSC's mission extends beyond its innovative smart contract capabilities. It aspires to become the driving force behind the integration of various cryptocurrencies, starting with Bitcoin, into the HIVE ecosystem through a process known as wrapping. This approach paves the way for the seamless transfer and utilization of Bitcoin and potentially other cryptocurrencies within the HIVE network.

VSC's ambitious roadmap includes plans for extending this wrapping capability to Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and potentially more digital assets. Currently, the goal is to build a full fleged wrapping system for the above cryptocurrency. However, this might not work for all cryptocurrencies or all assets. As a result VSC has support for atomic cross chain swaps using HTLCs. HTLCs, a fundamental feature of VSC, enable secure and trustless cross-chain transactions. With HTLC support, users can lock up assets on one blockchain while simultaneously generating a cryptographic proof that unlocks the equivalent amount on HIVE, seamlessly bridging the two ecosystems, therefore ultimately contributing to a more integrated and versatile crypto landscape.

The full fleged wrapping approach we are going for is based off the [xclaim.io framework](https://xclaim.io). XClaim is a well known and trusted wrapping procedure currently in use on Ethereum & Polkadot. We will be applying similar concepts here for wrapping of Bitcoin & other cryptocurrencies onto Hive.
